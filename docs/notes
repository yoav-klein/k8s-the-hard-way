To do:
-----
* smoke tests
* kthwctl functions, see below

smoke tests
------------
- create a deployment
- create a service


kthwctl
---------
* bootstrap (V)
* reset (V)
* delete node (?)
* status

consider
-------
* test_networking is pretty lame, see if you can improve it


Investigate
-------------
* After insatlling the network plugin once, which brings the nodes
to a Ready state, and after deleteing the nodes and creating them again,
  they become Ready, although I removed the weavenet pods from the cluster.

Nice to have:
-----------
* before scp to nodes, check if already exist
* jsonschema
* implementing CNI plugin
